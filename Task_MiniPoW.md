**# Task Checklist for Mini Proof of Work Blockchain**

## Overview
This repository provides a step-by-step guide to building a lightweight Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain in Go. Each step is documented in detail, covering theoretical and practical aspects. The goal is to create a minimal resource-intensive blockchain that can run multiple nodes efficiently on a local machine.

## Documentation Structure
Each step has a dedicated README file inside the `docs/` directory.
