# Step 6: Mining Validation & Optimization

## Learning Objectives
- Validate mined blocks and optimize mining process.

## Implementation Tasks
1. Write a validation method for PoW to ensure integrity.
2. Optimize the hashing function for low-resource environments.
3. Write unit tests for mining logic and blockchain integrity.

## Notes
- [ ] Validation methods tested:
