# Step 5: Implement Proof of Work

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how PoW is integrated into the blockchain.

## Implementation Tasks
1. Define `ProofOfWork` struct.
2. Implement `NewProofOfWork` function to initialize PoW.
3. Create a method to prepare data for hashing.
4. Implement the mining loop with a simple hash function.
5. Adjust difficulty dynamically based on block time.

## Notes
