# Step 4: Implement Basic Blockchain Structure

## Learning Objectives
- Define `Block` struct with relevant fields.
  
## Implementation Tasks
1. Define `Block` struct:
   - Timestamp
   - Data (transactions/messages)
   - Previous block hash
   - Current block hash
   - Nonce

2. Implement `NewBlock` function to create new blocks.

3. Implement hash calculation function using a lightweight algorithm.
